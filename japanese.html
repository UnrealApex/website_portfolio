I started studying Japanese around 3 years ago, with around a year of hiatus and breaks. I've recently started up again,following the AJAT approach. I'll be sure to update this page in the future, I hope to be proficient within another two years. I know around 700 kanji at the moment.

Ok, new update. I've been going pretty ham on the studying, I currently know around 2400 characters. The goal is to know 3000 characters. Anki has worked wonders for this. Anyways, I'll update you when I hit 3000, but here are my stats for now.
